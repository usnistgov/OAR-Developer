# Open Access to Research Developer Repository (oar-developer)

The National Institute of Science and Technology ([NIST](https://www.nist.gov))  _Science Data Portal_ and _Public Data Repository_ software is a collection of shared software repositories developed for the NIST Open Access to Research (OAR) public data infrastructure.   These software repositories include functionality for discovery, search,  filtering and access to [NIST public data](https://www.nist.gov/open) as per government policy.  The underlying code base uses open platforms and standard semantic representations.  

The main web user entry point for NIST data dissemination and public access system is available at https://data.nist.gov.    Once a user completes a search operation,   a resulting list of records in the public data repository are available for exploration.   Underlying datasets may be downloaded.    

Goals for this suite of tools and services include implementation of community best practices for data and software solutions, facilitating [FAIR data principles](https://go-fair.org), and adherence to [federal data management and use requirements](https://resources.data.gov/).
